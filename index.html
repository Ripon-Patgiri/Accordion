      <div class="content-container">
        <div class="question">Natural VS Self-Created</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Mingyur Rinpoche describes suffering as being divided into two types,
          “natural suffering” and “self-created suffering.” The former is very
          straightforward, while the latter variety can sprawl out in all
          directions. Natural suffering is self-explanatory: it’s just an
          unavoidable part of being in a physical body, and to understand it,
          all you have to do is stub your toe, or have an attack of gallstones.
          Self-created suffering, on the other hand, is the worry and
          editorializing and other unnecessary mental activity that we bring to
          the equation. When we’re experiencing that type of suffering, we’re
          usually oblivious to the fact that we’re the ones generating it.

        <div class="answer">
          Classical Buddhist texts, of course, have much to say on the topic of
          suffering. The Sanskrit word dukkha doesn’t translate very well into
          any modern language, but it’s probably best translated as
          “dissatisfaction.” Dukkha has three primary aspects. The first is the
          suffering of change — the inevitable ups and downs of health and
          illness, praise and blame, wealth and poverty, and so on. We suffer
          from change when we cling to what we believe we need or want and
          aren’t open to accepting what’s actually happening.

        <div class="question">The Long and the Short of it</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Ultimately, the source of all the non-natural suffering we experience
          — that is to say, most of our suffering — resides in our entrenched
          yet mistaken views about how things are. You might call it “primordial
          ignorance.” To be free from the suffering that hounds us, we need to
          be able to uproot these false or erroneous perceptions. And happily,
          meditation gives us all the tools we need to do just that.
